## About Me:
I was told that the best way to motivate yourself is by publishing all of the horrible things you don't want the world to see to the public. That way, everyone can bask in the mess ups, skrew ups, and general bad way to go about things, and in the afterglow of embarrassment - there is slight improvement.

I'm an electrical engineer wearing the mask of a software engineer, and welcome to my page :)
